                <h2>Why Travel Actively with Acme Adventure Travel</h2>
                <strong><em>Freedom... discovery... energy... inspiration... engagement... serendipity.</em></strong> <br />These are some of the words Acme Adventure Travel guests use to describe why they love exploring by bike and on foot.
                Active travel is about journeying through a fascinating region under your own power. On foot and on a bike, you can really get a visceral sense of place. Without any filters, you're free to truly be where you are. The wind in
                your face. The sun on your back. Reconnecting with yourself and others. The feeling that right now, and for the next few days, you control your own destiny. And always just ahead, the next unexpected moment you'll carry with
                you forever: a ruined castle shrouded in mist as the sun appears over the mountains... a flock of birds rising in a shimmering cloud from a vast river delta... a waiter lighting lamps on the caf&eacute; tables, saluting the village priest as he climbs the cathedral steps...

                <strong>Serious About Quality The Acme Adventure Travel Quality Guide</strong><br />
                A travel experience is not like purchasing a new bike&mdash;you can't give it a test ride. You have to be able to trust what the people providing that experience tell you. Unfortunately, we've seen too many examples of
                companies quietly subcontracting all aspects of their trips to others and seriously limiting the amount of control they have over trip quality.
                See how we are committed to unsurpassed quality that no other travel company can match.

Guests tell us constantly that our Trip Leaders are the best they've ever traveled with, rating their performance consistently at 9.7 out of 10 on post-trip surveys. We make sure those scores stay up there by running the most rigorous recruiting, training and guest satisfaction programs in the business.

                <strong>Responsible Travel</strong><br />
                Acme Adventure Travel has been taking responsible travel seriously since our first trip in 1979. After all, traveling on two feet or two wheels is the ultimate minimal-impact approach to travel. But we also recognize that any travel has an impact, so we do everything we can to make that impact positive.
            </p>

            <p>
                * <strong>Over 95% </strong>of Acme Adventure Travel guests on scheduled trips travel with three Acme Adventure Travel trip leaders or support staff, and two or more vehicles. We even add a fourth leader for meet and move days on some of our most logistically complex trips with the most guests to ensure everyone enjoys the best possible support. On less than 5% of scheduled trips, the number of guests is small enough that we can maintain our trademark high service standards with just two leaders and one van.
